# WorkAdventure Backend Agents

This file provides instructions for agents working on the WorkAdventure backend codebase.

## Demo Mode

To enable demo mode, set the `DEMO_MODE` environment variable to `true`. When demo mode is enabled, the backend will use mock services for all external dependencies, including Google APIs. This allows for a quick and easy way to run the backend locally without needing to set up any external services.
