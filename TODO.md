# TODO
- Get meetings auto created
  - the first person entering the room is the host
  - Figure out how communication should work
    - Get backend to track "state" of rooms
      - Broadcast state to all newly joined users
        - State => active rooms and meeting links
      - On connect, backend uses socket lib to let client know about state
      - As time goes on, client listens for other client's broadcasts
    - Broadcast to all users on floor
      - back/SocketManager.ts
        - Special server-sent messages
          - [SERVER:START] for starting meetings
            - ðŸ”¥ for testing, otherwise hard to see unicode?
              - needs room ID, meeting link
          - [SERVER:STOP] for stopping meetings
            - ðŸŒŠ
              - needs room ID
        - Client parses through all messages to see if it finds [SERVER:STOP] for it's room ID
          - Exit conditions for search
            - One pair of start/stop found 
              - Start-stop => need to start new meeting
              - Stop-start => need to join meeting
            - End of chat history window found
              - Just start => Join
              - Just stop => Start
- Kill call when co-website closed?
- Figure out what exactly the pusher does
  - gRPC?
    - Should I copy the new generated messages into the back too?
    - Do I need a new emitter?
  - Zone.ts?
    - What is a zone?
    - SocketManager emitZoneMessage
